**Paper Goal**: Propose MC-ViViT to detect MCI from NC via the facial videos of the interviews (I-CONECT dataset).

The experiments show that MC-ViViT can predict well with the help of MC and HP Loss. 

**Good news**: Transformer-based model can tell whether or not the people have MCI merely by analyzing the casual 
chatting videos. 

The interview videos from I-CONECT Study is **easy to access**, **low cost**, **time-saving**, **flexible**, and 
**less restricted** than medical images (MRI and CT Scan), collected demographic information, the answers for the 
specific questions. 

It is very valuable to spread and propagate.

Thank you for reading.
