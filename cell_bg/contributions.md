# Contributions

The follows are the changes to address the issues raised by the past works.

- Propose MC-ViViT (multi-branch classifier ViViT), a Transformer-based model, to detect MCI.
- Develop MC module to enrich the extracted spatio-temporal features. Its multi-branch structure helps ViViT to 
capture the visual features from different perspectives.
