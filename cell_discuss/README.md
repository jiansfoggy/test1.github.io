This paper is to propose MC-ViViT to detect MCI from I-CONECT dataset, the interview videos. 
The experiments show that MC-ViViT can predict well with the help of MC and HP Loss. 
Simultaneously, it shows that Transformer-based model can tell whether or not the people have MCI merely by analyzing 
I-CONECT interview videos. 
Compared with MRI, CT Scan, collecting demographic information, answering specific questions, the interview from I-CONECT 
Study is easy to access, low cost, time-saving, flexible, and less restricted. 
It is very valuable to spread and propagate.

Thank you for reading.
